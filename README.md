# custom_login_help

These are relatively simple HTML, CSS, and Javascript snippets you can add to your login.jsp or login-ultra.jsp template files

1. Make 3rd party links more pronounced and availble elsewhere on the page
2. Toggle (show/hide) the direct login form fields
3. Basic background image updates
